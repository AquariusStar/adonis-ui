# Contributing to Adonis UI
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added or changed features, update the documentation.
3. Ensure your changes run on all target frameworks.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/benruehl/adonis-ui/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/benruehl/adonis-ui/issues/new/choose). You will be asked to choose from different templates. Each template will give you guidance to create a meaningful issue. It's that easy!

## Use a consistent coding style
Please be consistent with the project's coding style. It makes maintaining easier and helps other developers understand the code. The project follows the default styling rules of Visual Studio and ReSharper.

## Use a consistent commit message style

Please adapt to the project's commit message style to keep browsing the history enjoyable. We use [Tim Pope's commit message format](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

In short:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Please have a look at [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams for an in-depth explanation with examples.
